# Composing

Now that we know how to create routes and have some insights into what we can do, let's discuss `petitions` and `composer` and explore why they exist.

The TL;DR is that `petitions` create `typed objects` that maintain structure across versions, think about it as an abstract route. You can link these objects together like Legos, and also compose them into functional units with `composer` to use within Vixeny or wherever else they may be needed.

```ts
import { composer, petitions } from "vixeny";

const req = new Request("http://localhost/");

// Creating a resolve
const getHello = petitions.resolve()({
  f: () => "hello",
});

// Creating a Petition
const response = petitions.standard()({
  // This function is the endpoint for the request
  path: "/THIS_FUNCTION_DOES_HAVE_A_ROUTER",
  resolve: {
    getHello,
  },
  f: ({ resolve }) => new Response(resolve.getHello),
});

// Composing the Petition
const composedPetition = composer.petition(response);

// Composing the Resolve
const composedResolve = composer.anyRequest()(getHello);

console.log(
  // Outputs "hello"
  composedResolve(req),
  // Returns true
  composedResolve(req) ===
    await Promise
      .resolve(composedPetition(req))
      .then((res) => res.text()),
);
```

You will find a detailed explanation of them in `library`.

Your explanation about the maintainability of Vixeny code offers valuable insights into the benefits of the framework. I'll refine your text for better clarity and grammatical correctness. Hereâ€™s an improved version:

## Maintainability

Until now, we've primarily focused on functions from `Vixeny`. This focus isn't simply because the project is functional in nature, but also because Vixeny ensures that all exported functions are self-contained, promoting:

- **Future-Proof**: Code written today in Vixeny will remain valid in the future.
- **Adaptability**: Bug corrections and extensions can be implemented without breaking existing code.

Consider the following example:

```ts
import { petitions } from "vixeny";

// Creating a resolve
const getHello = petitions.resolve()({
  f: () => "hello",
});

console.log(getHello);
```

Although `getHello` may seem to be just an object with the key `f`, logging this function reveals:

```js
{
  f: [Function: f],
  type: "morphism",
  isUsing: [],
  isAsync: false,
  o: undefined,
  ... // and potentially more attributes in the future
}
```

It's crucial to understand that this object is `readonly`. Once `getHello` is defined, its structure and behavior cannot be altered by any of Vixeny's tools, which helps to safeguard the integrity and stability of your applications against unexpected side effects.
