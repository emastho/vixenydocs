Now you may say, that's a lot, and yes, some tutorials repeat, some are worse than the others, the idea is 

The more you open yourself to FP content, the more information of it will stay in your head.

By the way, all the above content, I watched/read.

### If I could say what exactly you need to know to be able to use this library correctly it would probably be:

Anonymous functions

How primitive and reference values are passed to functions

Higher order functions

Array .map, .filter .reduce, .flatMap

How to make anything immutable

Closures

What is currying

What is partial application

What is function composition

What is a side effect

What is a pure function

Dependency injection using functions

From here on you should read the "Mostly adequate guide to FP" or watch "Professor Frisby course" above, you will know some stuff, so you will be able to just repeat some knowledge and secure it in your mind. From Chapter 08 you'll start learning about them scary Functors/Monads and other fancy named Boxes, that you'll need to write functional code using the way, I'll teach you in the following page.

<br />

Don't be scared, the more you learn, the easier it will be to connect how it all works.
